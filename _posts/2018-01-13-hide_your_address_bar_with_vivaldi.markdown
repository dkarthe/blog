Want a little more screen real estate?

The Vivaldi browser has become my daily driver for much of my _config_ work at GrantBook.

I use the `CTRL` + `L` shortcut a fair bit to jump to the address bar with my keyboard. Because that's easy to remember, I've set `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `L` to hide the address bar in Vivaldi. On some websites, I just don't need it.

You set it up like this.

I still use Chrome for its convenient `Add to desktop` feature to access my email, calendar, task manager and other apps in standalone windows, but Vivaldi is where I work on my projects.
